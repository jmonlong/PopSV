Description: Detect abnormal read coverage using a set of samples as
    references. From high-throughput sequencing, the genome is binned and read
    mapping to each bin are counted. From these read counts, PopSV test, in
    each bin, is the read counts are different between a sample of interest and
    a set of reference samples. Functions for pre/post-processing are also
    provided.
