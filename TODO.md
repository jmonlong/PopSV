## Bug to fix

+ Keep/guess best chr factor order (1:22,X,Y). Eg. in `freq.range`'s output.

## For next version

+ Add new chr-frequency graph in `sv.summary.interactive`.
+ Add coverage distribution in `sv.summary.interactive`.
+ Add filter on estimated copy number in `sv.summary.interactive`.
+ Pick reference as : cluster with the most samples except if around null coverage and another cluster has at least X samples (e.g. 20).
+ Implement/test the aneuploidy map.
+ More unit tests
+ merge experimental branches: 2bams, XY.
