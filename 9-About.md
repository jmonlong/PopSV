This software is being developed in [Guillaume Bourque's lab](http://www.computationalgenomics.ca/BourqueLab/) as part of Jean Monlong's PhD project.

Please [contact me](mailto:jean.monlong@mail.mcgill.ca) if you have any questions, comments or suggestions. You can also [create an issue on the GitHub repository](https://github.com/jmonlong/PopSV/issues) (so that other users can see the exchange).

## Acknowledgment 

PopSV heavily uses [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) packages. [BatchJobs](https://github.com/tudo-r/BatchJobs) package also greatly simplified the implementation of an efficient pipeline.
