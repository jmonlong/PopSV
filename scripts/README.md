## Scripts

- `batchtools`: scripts to run PopSV in a HPC using [*batchtools*](https://mllg.github.io/batchtools/). *batchtools* is the successor of *BatchJobs* and should be more stable, easier to use, and provides more features. **Recommended**.
- `BatchJobs`: scripts to run PopSV in a HPC using [*BatchJobs*](https://github.com/tudo-r/BatchJobs).
- `run-PopSV-local.R`: a toy example to illustrate they different functions in the package. To run a real analysis, we highly recommend using the automated pipeline that uses either *batchtools* or *BatchJobs*.
