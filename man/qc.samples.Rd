\usage{
qc.samples(files.df, bin.df, outfile.prefix, ref.samples = NULL,
  nb.ref.samples = NULL, plot = TRUE, appendIndex.outfile = TRUE,
  chunk.size = 1e+05, col.bc = "bc.gc.gz", nb.cores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{files.df}{a data.frame with the information about the files to
use. Columns 'sample' and 'bc.gc.bg' are required and should be
present  after running 'initFileNames' function. Files should exist if
'correct.GC' was run.}

\item{bin.df}{a data.frame with the information about the bins. Columns 'chr', 'start'
and 'end' are required.}

\item{outfile.prefix}{the prefix of the name of the output file. The suffix '.bgz' will
be appended if compressed ('appendIndex.outfile=TRUE').}

\item{ref.samples}{a vector with the names of the samples planned to be used
as reference.}

\item{nb.ref.samples}{the number of reference samples desired. Default is the size of 'ref.samples'.}

\item{plot}{should PCA graphs be outputed. Default is TRUE.}

\item{appendIndex.outfile}{if TRUE (default), the results will be appended regularly on
the output file which will be ultimately indexed. This is recommend when a large number
of bins are analyzed. If FALSE, a data.frame with the bin counts will be returned and no
file are created.}

\item{chunk.size}{the number of bins to analyze at a time (for memory optimization).
Default is 100 000. Reduce this number if memory problems arise.}

\item{col.bc}{the column from 'files.df' defining the bin count file names.}

\item{nb.cores}{number of cores to use. If higher than 1, \code{parallel}
package is used to parallelized the counting.}
}
\value{
a list with
\item{bc}{the name of the file with the joined bin counts OR a data.frame with
these bin counts.}
\item{ref.samples}{a vector with the reference samples names.}
\item{cont.sample}{the name of the sample to use as control among the reference samples (for normalization).}
\item{pc.all.df}{a data.frame with the first 3 principal components for all input reference samples.}
\item{pc.ref.df}{a data.frame with the first 3 principal components for the final reference samples.}
}
