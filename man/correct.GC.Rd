\title{Correct GC bias}
\usage{
correct.GC(bc.f, gc.df, outfile.prefix, appendIndex.outfile = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{bc.f}{the name of the file with the bin cont for a particular sample OR
a data.frame with 4 columns: 'chr', 'start', 'end' and 'bc'.}

\item{gc.df}{a data.frame with the bin deifnition and GC content information.
Column 'GCcontent' is required and can be obtained thanks to 'getGC.hp19' for
example.}

\item{outfile.prefix}{the prefix of the name of the output file. The suffix '.bgz' will
be appended to this name prefix after compression.}

\item{appendIndex.outfile}{if TRUE (default), the results will be saved on the
output file which will be ultimately indexed. This is recommend when a large number
of bins are analyzed. If FALSE, a data.frame with the corrected bin counts will
be returned and no file are created.}
}
\value{
the name of the file with the corrected bin counts OR a new data.frame
with corrected bin counts.
}
\description{
Correct GC bias by fitting a LOESS model. The bin counts are then corrected
with a continuous normalization factor derived from the predicted bin count
and global average bin count.
