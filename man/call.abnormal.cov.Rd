}
\arguments{
\item{z}{the name of the file with the Z-scores for all samples OR or a
data.frame with the Z-scores for all samples.}

\item{files.df}{a data.frame with the paths to different sample files (bin count, Z-scores, ..). Here column 'z' and 'fc' are used to retrieve Z-scores and fold changes.}

\item{samp}{the name of the sample to analyze.}

\item{out.pdf}{the name of the output pdf file.}

\item{FDR.th}{the False Discovery Rate to use for the calls. Further filtering
can always be performed.}

\item{merge.cons.bins}{how the bins should be merged. Default is 'stitch'. 'zscores' is another approch (see Details), 'no' means no bin merging.}

\item{stitch.dist}{the maximal distance between two calls to be merged into one (if 'merge.cons.bins="stitch"'). If NULL (default), the bin size + 1 is used.}

\item{z.th}{how the threshold for abnormal Z-score is chosen. Default is 'sdest' which will use 'FDR.th=' parameter as well. 'consbins' looks at the number of consecutive bins, see Details.}

\item{fc}{the name of the file with the copy number estimates for all samples OR
or a data.frame with the copy number estimates for all samples.}

\item{norm.stats}{the name of the file with the normalization statistics ('norm.stats' in 'tn.norm' function) or directly a 'norm.stats' data.frame.}

\item{min.normal.prop}{the minimum proportion of the regions expected to be normal. Default is 0.5. For cancers with many large aberrations, this number can be lowered. Maximum value accepted is 0.98 .}

\item{aneu.chrs}{the names of the chromosomes to remove because flagged as aneuploid. If NULL (default) all chromosomes are analyzed.}

\item{ref.dist.weight}{the weight (value between 0 and 1) based on the distance to the reference samples.}
}
\value{
a data.frame with columns
\item{chr, start, end}{the genomic region definition}
\item{z}{the Z-score}
\item{pv, qv}{the P-value and Q-value(~FDR)}
\item{fc}{the copy number estimate (if 'fc' was not NULL).}
\item{nb.bin.cons}{the number of consecutive bins (if the bins were merged;
'merge.cons.bins!='no'')}
\item{cn2.dev}{Copy number deviation from the reference }

\description{
Detect abnormal bin from the Z-score distribution. A normal distribution is first
fitted to the Z-score distribution. P-values are computed from this estimated
null distribution and corrected for multiple testing. Eventually consecutive bins
with abnormal read counts can be merged.
}
\details{
Two approaches can be used to define if a bin has abnormal threshold. By default ('sdest'), the null Normal distribution standard deviation is estimated by sequencially trimming the Z-score distribution and using an estimator for censored values. Once the Z-scores corresponding to the abnormal bins are trimmed out, the estimator reaches a plateau which is used as estimator for the null standard deviation. Using this parameter, P-values and Q-values are computed; abnormal bins are then defined by a user-defined FDR threshold on the Q-values. An alternative approach, 'consbins', looks at the distribution of consecutive bins to define the best threshold on the Z-scores. A wide range of thresholds are eplored. For each threshold, selected bins are stitched together if directly consecutive and the proportion of single  and pair bins is computed. With a loose value-many selected bins-, pairs of consecutive bins happen by chance. More stringent values decreases the proportion of pairs and increases the number of single bins until it reaches true calls that are more likely to be consecutive. The Z-score threshold is defined as the changepoint between random and true calls distribution.

Two approaches are available to merge bins with abnormal read coverage. 'stitch' simply stitches bins passing a user-defined significance threshold. In this approach, the stitching distance specifies the maximum distance between two bins that will be merged. By default the bin size is used, i.e. two abnormal bins will be merged if separated by maximum one bin. 'zscores' approach looks at the Z-score of two consecutive bins: if the minimum(maximum) is significantly higher(lower) than a simulated null distribution, these two bins will be merged to create a larger duplication(deletion).
