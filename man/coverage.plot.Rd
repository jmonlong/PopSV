\title{Plot the bin coverage in a region}
\usage{
coverage.plot(chr, start, end, bc.f, norm.stats.f = NULL, sv.df = NULL,
  ref.samples = NULL, boxplot = FALSE, samples = NULL, files.df = NULL,
  anno.df = NULL, anno.col = "geneName", flanks = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{chr}{the chromosome}

\item{start}{the start position of the region}

\item{end}{the end position of the region}

\item{bc.f}{the path to the bin count file.}

\item{norm.stats.f}{the path to the normalization statistics file.}

\item{sv.df}{the data.frame with the calls.}

\item{ref.samples}{the names of the reference samples.}

\item{boxplot}{should the reference be represented as boxplots. If FALSE, violin plots will be used.}

\item{samples}{the set of samples to represent.}

\item{files.df}{a data.frame with the path to the different files associated with each sample. If 'sample' is absent from 'bc.f' the correct file from 'files.df' will be used. Default is NULL.}

\item{anno.df}{a data.frame with additional information (e.g. gene annotation) to be added to the graph.}

\item{anno.col}{the name of 'anno.df' column to use to differentiate elements in the graph. E.g. 'geneName' to color the genes in the graph.}

\item{flanks}{the size of the flanking region. Default is 10000.}
}
\value{
a ggplot object
}
\description{
Plot the bin coverage in a genomic regions across samples. The files ('bc.f', 'norm.stats.f') must be ordered and indexed.
