\title{P-values estimation from mixture of 2 centered normal}
\usage{
fdrtool.quantile.2N(z)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{a vector with the Z-scores}
}
\value{
a list with
\item{sigma.est.dup}{the estimated null distribution variance for positive Z-scores}
\item{sigma.est.del}{the estimated null distribution variance for negative Z-scores}
}
\description{
Compute the null variances. Here the null distribution is modeled as two Normal distrution centered in 0. The variance are fitted to the empirical distribution. P-values and Q-values are derived from the Z-score and this fitted null distribution.
