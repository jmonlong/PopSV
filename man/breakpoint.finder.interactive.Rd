\description{
Interactive tool to fine tune breakpoint location from the BAM files. An interactive Shiny app will open in your web browser. There, the bp coverage of the `test.sample` will be shown along with the coverage of the reference samples (`ref.samples`). The user can then slide the breakpoint where the tested samples starts to deviate from the reference. If the deviation is not clear a few parameters (e.g. mapping quality, resolution) can be changed live. Once satisfied the user pushes a button and the function returns the new breakpoint locations. In practice this function can be looped over to quickly fine-tune the breakpoints of several CNVs.

\details{
Access to the BAM files is necessary, but also to a web-browser (for the application). Hence I would recommend to mount the cluster/server with the BAM on your personnal laptop to use this. Then you might need to tweak a bit the paths in the 'bam' column of 'files.df' to include your mounting location.
